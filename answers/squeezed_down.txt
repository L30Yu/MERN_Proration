Prompt
~~~~~~

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

Response
~~~~~~~~
I would gather some stakeholders together when communicating with the angry investor, and always
keep in mind that it's important to be transparent and empathetic. Try our best to express the reason
of causing the issue. If we can not directly talk with our investor, we would sending email with 
details like how we will avoid this issue happen again.

one possible solution could be to implement a tiered system where investors who have consistently 
invested with the company over a longer period of time receive a higher allocation percentage than 
newer investors. This could incentivize investors to continue investing with the company and help 
to build stronger relationships with them.
